Documentation Instructions
==========================

Instructions
-------------

In this folder, please include a representative writing sample.

This is the meat of the application, as it will demonstrate your capabilities as a technical author. 

Please include a basic how-to guide for accomplishing a daily task (brushing your teeth, making coffee, etc.)

Alternatively, you may submit a guide documenting an electronics project you have built. Include all relevant information needed for someone to replicate the project. 

You may also include links to any previous publications you may have online. 

Requirements
-------------

* Formatted in Markdown
* Images/diagrams that are attributed properly
* Enough details for a beginner to successfully accomplish the task or replicate the project

Additional points
------------------

* How-to guides will be read, not executed.  
* Less is more (clear, concise information is the best)
* This must be your original work. Any partial contributions from others should be attributed.
